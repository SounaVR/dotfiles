# Souna's dotfiles
Garbage repository to store my dotfiles.

Managed with [yadm](https://github.com/TheLocehiliosan/yadm).

## Personal TODO for later or idk
- [ ] archinstall repo
- [x] [discord selfbot repo](https://github.com/SounaVR/sounarch-selfbot) for music stuff on arch
- [ ] yadm bootstrap
- [x] Get vban_receptor working (tf is wrong with linux audio)
- [ ] Do an Alexa like to invoke my music script
- [ ] Learn neovim and get gud
- [x] Get a delicious nice looking terminal
